## About the project, brief description
The goal of this project is to create a more efficient version of the SAP-3 (Simple As Possible) computer.

Credits are given to Albert Paul Malvino and Jerald A. Brown for introducing this architecture in their book Digital Computer Electronics and Ben Eater for implementing his own version of the SAP Computer using IC's and breadboards.

## ISAP-3 version 1.0
The initial version I want to be a redesign of the SAP-3 computer. For this purpose, we must go through the steps followed by the authors of the original project.

Version 1.0 will be an implementation of the SAP-3 computer that is as close to the original as possible. This will be the reference, the starting point for creating a better version.
